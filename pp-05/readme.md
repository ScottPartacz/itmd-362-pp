## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=22V1c0kvFaRFJ6vst8onPjRged+
Your Rationale: I have always made the connection of green and red with video games. Also i think these colors are not flashy but sleek and ina  good way netural.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=32V0G0kq+q3geTHiUHwSng1Zqc2
Your Rationale: These colors are bright and beautiful. They will remind the past guests of the garden and intrigue people who have never went.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=53l090kPRijzrfn8NdUrtcIo39J
Your Rationale: These color are plain and simplistic. In other words enough to make the user notice the colors but not to distracte the user from the purpose of the app.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=15z090kmweCfdvy6VqzLxpx77af
Your Rationale: I went with a soft and light ruby color. I just think these colors blend really well.
