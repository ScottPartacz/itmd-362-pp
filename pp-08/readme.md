# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: looking at this simple pencil your mind becomes enthralled with the endless possiblities that come from it.

* Behavioral: Using this pencil is easy yet satisfing. The pencil came be used for hours and yet you never get tired.

* Reflective: After using the pencil you feel strength and power. You have created somehting from this pencil. without the pencil youstart to feel not whole.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Easy to use
2. You understand the purpose of it immediately
3. Simple yet beautiful
