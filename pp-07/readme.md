# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/loading/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: When the user clicks to login in there wil be a symbol to show that the page is laoding instead of the user wondering whats happening.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742486.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: A big think wrong with the myittportal is how it is laid out in my sketch the login procces takes up a whole page so the user can understand what to do. also the page is mpobie responive.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/text-fields/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I Implemented this by puting what your suppose to enter in each text field to the left i.e. the text field for your username there "username:" to the left of that field.
