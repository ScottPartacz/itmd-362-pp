# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

I really enjoy this website, however their login box on the desktop/laptop view is way to small. So that is what I would like to change.

Mobile: There mobile layout is great in my opinon only downside is maybe they need to increase the szie of the loin button. but thats very minor.

HTML: Nothing really needs to be change however I would add a pattern for the username and password.

CSS:This is where the bulk of what i want to change will come into play. But again this would be a simple fix just make the conatiner holding the box bigger and scale the font-size with the increase of the box.

JS: The only chnage i can see that would make this function better would be to make the login button disabled or not visbale till you meet the patterns in the HTML.
